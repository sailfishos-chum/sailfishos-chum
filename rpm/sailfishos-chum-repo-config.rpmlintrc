# On behalf of Jolla's tar_git / SailfishOS-OBS:
# - It re-writes the DistURL, rendering it inconsistent
addFilter('invalid-url DistURL obs:')
# - It has a limited list of FLOSS-licenses, most SDPX-IDs are missing
addFilter('invalid-license')
# - It extracts strange changelog entries out of Git, if a %%changelog section is used
addFilter('incoherent-version-in-changelog')
# - It sometimes re-writes the %version-%release strings of package names, 
#   when referencing (only) a branch (i.e., not a git tag), for example,
#   0.5.2-1 to 0.5.2+main.20230129011931.1.g584263a-1.8.1.jolla
addFilter('filename-too-long-for-joliet')

# On behalf of the SailfishOS:Chum specification:
# - which re-uses the spec file tag "Url:"
addFilter('tag-in-description Url:')
# - which also re-uses the spec file tag "Icon:"
addFilter('tag-in-description Icon:')
# - which makes one easily do
addFilter('description-line-too-long')
setBadness('description-line-too-long', 0)

# On our own behalf:
# - This is how it ought to be
addFilter('obsolete-not-provided sailfishos-chum')
addFilter('unversioned Obsoletes: Obsoletes:  *sailfishos-chum')
# - This is also how it ought to be
addFilter('meego-filelist-empty')
# - This is how it ought to be, too
addFilter('dangerous-command-in-%postun rm')
# - This is due to the former name of this source-repository and its files.
#   It makes sense to rename the spec file and move the Repo Config RPM(s) 
#   out of the "main" repo to a new repo "sailfishos-chum-repo-config".
#   DONE as of 2023-02-19, hence "commenting out":
# addFilter('invalid-spec-name')
# setBadness('invalid-spec-name', 0)
